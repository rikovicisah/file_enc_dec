    üìÅ Encrypt and decrypt all files within a folder.

    üîë Uses a user-provided key for both encryption and decryption.

    -e: Encrypt the specified file or folder.

    -d: Decrypt the specified file or folder.

    -k <key>: Provide the encryption/decryption key.

File Naming Convention

When encrypting files in a folder:

    Each output file will be named with _e suffix followed by an index number.

    Example: file.txt ‚Üí file_e(1).txt, file_e(2).txt, etc.

Example

./filecryptor -e -k mySecretKey file.txt encrypted_file.txt
./filecryptor -d -k mySecretKey encrypted_file.txt decrypted_file.txt

Notes

    The program expects three arguments: the operation (-e or -d), the key (-k <key>), and the input/output files or folders.

    The first argument is always the program name itself (argv[0]), followed by user-provided arguments.
